# Blackjack

Remaking blackjack in java and Eclipse. Mostly for git and github branch practice.

The game is based on "Soft 17" rule, where the dealer - computer has to hit until a minimum of 17 and then stay.

The player can get initial chips, bet chips each round, can hit and stay, the game lasts until the player chooses to end or runs out of chips.

Current implementation - deck with ArrayList and values for each card in Hashtable. PlayGame main class currently only for testing methods.
